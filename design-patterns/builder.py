### --- Builder Pattern --- ###

# The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.

# When to use:
# - When you need to build an object in multiple steps.
# - When you need to build different representations of an object.

# How to implement:
# - Separate the construction in a builder class.
# - Create methods in the builder class to set the properties of the object.
# - Create a build method that returns the final object.
