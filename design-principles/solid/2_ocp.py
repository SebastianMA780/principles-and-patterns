### --- Open Closed Principle --- ###

# software should be open for extension but closed for modification

# Open for extension means:
# It allows us to add new features without modifying existing code
# we can achieve this by using inheritance and polymorphism

# Closed means:
# avoid changing existing code that has been tested and works
# It promotes encapsulation and stability of the system
