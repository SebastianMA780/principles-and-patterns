# Principles and Patterns Repository

Welcome to my **Principles and Patterns** repository! 📐💡

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to collecting and organizing information about design principles and patterns. It serves as a personal reference to deepen my understanding of software design and development best practices.

## What's Inside
- **Design Principles** - Key concepts and guidelines for writing clean and maintainable code.
- **Design Patterns** - Classic patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and more.
- **Examples** - Code snippets demonstrating how to implement and use principles and patterns.
- **Notes** - Explanations and insights to reinforce my understanding.

Feel free to explore the content, and I’m open to suggestions to make it even better!
